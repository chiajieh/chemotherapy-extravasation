('DAUNOrubicin', 'Vesicant', null, 'Dexrazoxane', 'Apply cold pack for 15-20 minutes at least 4 times a day for the first 24 hours. Remove cold pack at least 15 minutes prior to dexrazoxane treatment. The recommended dose of dexrazoxane is based on the patient\'s body surface area: Day 1: 1,000 mg/m2, Day 2: 1,000 mg/m2, Day 3: 500 mg/m2. The maximum recommended dose is 2,000 mg on days 1 and 2 and 1,000 mg on day 3. The dose should be reduced 50% in patients with creatinine clearance values < 40 ml/min. Preparation: Each 500 mg vial of dexrazoxane must be mixed with 50 ml diluent. The patient\'s dose is then added to a 1,000 ml normal saline infusion bag for administration. Storage: Store at room temperature between 15C - 30C (59F - 86F). Initiate the first dexrazoxane infusion as soon as possible and within 6 hours of the anthracycline extravasation. Infuse dexrazoxane over 1-2 hours in a large vein in an area other than the extravasation area (e.g. opposite arm). The same arm should be used only when the patient\'s clinical sstatus (e.g. lymphedema, loss of limb) precludes use of the unaffected arm, and a large vein above the extravasation site should be used for dexrazoxane administration.
